Pact model
==========

The model project is responsible for providing:
*  a model to represent pacts
*  serialization and deserialization
*  comparison between two parts of the pact model
*  conversion between the pact model and whatever third party libraries used by the pact-consumer and pact-provider requires

You should never need to include this project directly
